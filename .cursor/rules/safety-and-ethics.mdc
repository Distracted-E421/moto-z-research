# Safety and Ethics Guidelines

## 🔒 Research Ethics

### What This Project IS

- ✅ Educational security research
- ✅ Right-to-repair advocacy
- ✅ Reducing e-waste by enabling device reuse
- ✅ Open-source tool development
- ✅ Understanding proprietary systems

### What This Project IS NOT

- ❌ A method to unlock stolen devices
- ❌ Circumvention for illegal purposes
- ❌ Commercial unlock service
- ❌ Warranty fraud enablement

## ⚠️ Safety Rules

### Device Operations

Before any firmware operation:
- [ ] Verify you have full backup via EDL
- [ ] Confirm EDL flashing works (test with known-good image)
- [ ] Have recovery plan documented
- [ ] Accept potential device loss

### Never Execute Without Confirmation

```bash
# ALWAYS ASK BEFORE:
fastboot oem unlock <key>      # Bootloader unlock
fastboot flash <part> <image>  # Partition flashing
edl w <part> <image>           # EDL write operations
```

### Firmware Backup Checklist

Before ANY modification:
- [ ] `abl_a.img` dumped
- [ ] `xbl_a.img` dumped  
- [ ] `tz_a.img` dumped
- [ ] `devinfo` dumped
- [ ] Full GPT backed up
- [ ] Verified dump integrity (SHA256)

## 🔐 Data Handling

### Never Commit to Public Repos

| Data Type | Example | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| IMEI | 352156100832017 | Device identifier |
| Unlock keys | XXXX-XXXX... | Device-specific |
| Private keys | RSA private | Security |
| Credentials | API tokens | Security |

### Safe to Share

| Data Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Analysis techniques | Ghidra scripts |
| Generic patterns | Certificate structure |
| Tools | Parsers, analyzers |
| Documentation | Research findings |

## 🎯 Responsible Disclosure

If you discover:
1. **Security vulnerability** → Report to Motorola first
2. **Bypass method** → Document privately, consider implications
3. **Tool that could be abused** → Add appropriate safeguards

### Disclosure Timeline

1. Private documentation
2. Vendor notification (90 days)
3. Public disclosure (with safeguards)
4. Tool release (with ethical guidelines)

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Generally Legal (US)

- Analyzing devices you own
- Security research (DMCA exemptions)
- Interoperability (reverse engineering for compatibility)
- Right to repair

### Potentially Problematic

- Circumventing DRM for non-permitted purposes
- Distributing circumvention tools commercially
- Unauthorized access to systems
- IMEI modification (federally illegal in US)

### When in Doubt

- Consult with legal counsel
- Document research purpose clearly
- Keep research private until reviewed
- Consider academic/non-profit frameworks

## 📋 Pre-Operation Checklist

### Before Flashing ANYTHING

```
□ Is this my own device?
□ Do I have complete backup?
□ Have I tested recovery procedure?
□ Do I understand what this will do?
□ Am I prepared for device loss?
□ Is there a safer alternative?
```

### Before Publishing ANYTHING

```
□ Does this contain identifying information?
□ Could this be used maliciously?
□ Have I considered responsible disclosure?
□ Is there educational value?
□ Have I added appropriate warnings?
```

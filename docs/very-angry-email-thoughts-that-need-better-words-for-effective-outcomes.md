Why is the error so god damn no-descroptive or healpful?

Ok, so to summarize the problem the way I see it: The device to older than you feel it "necassary" to keep the unlock codes around for, but you could do something about it, you just would rather not, cause policy lol. Instead of providing help to make a code, you say figure it out yourself. Except, after lots of research and effort, its not a code you can jsut crack without the server side code, and you won't give it to us. Or, some kind of knowledge of the rng behind the code to speculate on hacks that way. What database policy is this, and is that really the fucknig best you can do, sorry you put all this real effort into trying to salavage ewaste, go fuck yourself. 

Also, why not just realease all the codes to the public, so people can use them to salvage ewaste, and you can still make money off of it, and not have to deal with the hassle of people trying to unlock their devices?

or, if you wont release the codes, at least give us a way to unlock the device without the server side code, so we can at least salvage the ewaste. There are plenty of ways to do this, you just wont do it.

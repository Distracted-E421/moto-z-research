Hi  @distracted-e421 ,

I apologize that you are encountering this persistent problem with the bootloader unlock portal for your Moto Z4 (XT1980-3), despite your extensive technical verification confirming it should be eligible. I appreciate the high level of detail you provided, including the crucial CID 0x0032 and unlock_ability: 1 status.

While your technical data strongly indicates eligibility, the rejection is occurring at the server level due to a system constraint related to the device's age.

The reason the portal is rejecting your device is that the bootloader unlock key is no longer available in the database due to the device's age.

Unlock codes are only retained for a period of approximately four (4) years from the initial loading and provisioning of the customer software. Since the Moto Z4 was released in mid-2019, its unlock code has likely expired from the active database.

I understand this is frustrating, especially for a developer looking to repurpose a retail device. Unfortunately, due to this database policy, we cannot manually generate or retrieve the key to override the portal's rejection.

I recommend continuing to monitor the developer forums, as community members sometimes find and share alternative methods for older devices, although these are not officially supported.

Regards,
Jess
